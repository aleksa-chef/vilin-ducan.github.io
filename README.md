Responsive Website that represent decoupage art products.

I made this as one of my first Websites. I make wireframes and mock-ups in Figma, the best tool for Web Designers and Web Developers, in my opinion. After that I have coded the entire  design in VS Code and I uses front-end language such as HTML, CSS, SCSS and JavaScript. Take a look of my website, I really try my best to make it Responsive and good-looking. I will continue to make progress and to make new Websites. Stay tuned.
